    """Intercept requests wanting to serve files and serve those files.

    Tornado's WSGI adapter contravenes the specification by buffering
    the entire output produced by a handler rather than streaming it
    down as soon as it's available (even when an explicit flush is
    issued). This is especially problematic when serving files, as it
    causes them to be entirely loaded into memory, providing a vector
    for a denial-of-service attack.

    This class is one half of a two-part solution to this problem. When
    a Tornado handler wants to serve a file it instead serves an empty
    response with custom headers. This middleware looks out for
    responses of that form and, when it encounters one, it fetches and
    streams back the file that was requested, using a proper compliant
    way.
