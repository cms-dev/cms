"""Package containing utilities for accepting submissions in CWS.

Some of the functions use a common "format" to represent the files sent
by the contestants as part of a submission or user test: it is a list of
ReceivedFile objects, each with an optional codename, optional filename
and content. The list is intended to represent a multiset, hence order
is irrelevant and duplicates are allowed.
