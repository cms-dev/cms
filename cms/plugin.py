def plugin_list(entry_point_group: str) -> list[type]:
    """Return the list of plugin classes of the given group.

    The aspects of CMS that require the largest flexibility in behavior
    are controlled by arbitrary Python code, encapsulated in classes
    (e.g., task and score types, languages, ...). CMS ships with
    collections of common options for these, but users can provide
    their own custom ones using a plugin system. This is based on
    setuptools' entry points: distributions (e.g., PyPI packages) can
    list some of their classes in the entry_points section of their
    setup.py inside some CMS-specific groups and, once they are
    installed, CMS will be able to automatically discover and use those
    classes.

    entry_point_group: the name of the group of entry points that
        should be returned, typically one of cms.grading.tasktypes,
        scoretypes or languages.

    return: the requested plugin classes.
