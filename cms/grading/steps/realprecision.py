"""High level functions to perform standardized real-number comparison.

Policy:
- Tokenization: only fixed-format decimals (no exponent, no inf/nan).
  Accepted examples: "12", "12.", "12.34", ".5", "-0.0", "+3.000"
  Rejected examples: "1e-3", "nan", "inf", "0x1.8p3"
- Tolerance: 1e-6 absolute OR 1e-6 * max(1, |a|, |b|) relative.
- Pairwise comparison in order in case the number of fixed-format decimals
  is the same, otherwise the files are considered different.
