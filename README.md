Introduction
------------

CMS, or Contest Management System, is a distributed system for running
and (to some extent) organizing a programming contest.

CMS has been designed to be general and to handle many different types
of contests, tasks, scorings, etc. Nonetheless, CMS has been
explicitly build to be used in the 2012 International Olympiad in
Informatics, held in September 2012 in Italy.


Download
--------

**For end-users it's best to download the latest stable version of CMS,
which can be found already packaged at <http://cms-dev.github.io/>.**

This git repository, which contains the development version in its
master branch, is intended for developers and everyone interested in
contributing or just curious to see how the code works and wanting to
hack on it.

Please note that since the sandbox is contained in a
[git submodule](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) you should append
`--recursive` to the standard `git clone` command to obtain it. Or, if
you have already cloned CMS, simply run the following command from
inside the repository:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```
